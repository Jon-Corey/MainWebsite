        <p>Vector Text is a tool for converting text to an SVG path. This is useful since using fonts directly in an SVG can be problematic, especially when it comes to compatibility.</p>

        <p>Most tools either don't support choosing a font at all or don't support external fonts, which can lead to those tools using a different font when rendering the SVG. That leads to the SVG looking different depending on where it's viewed. That's a problem.</p>

        <p>Vector Text takes your text and converts it into an SVG path, ensuring that it looks the same no matter where it's viewed.</p>

        <p>It's also completely free with no ads or trackers. If you appreciate it and want to support this tool and future tools I create, consider supporting me on <a href="https://patreon.com/JonCorey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Patreon</a>.</p>

        <h2 id="why-i-built-vector-text">Why I Built Vector Text</h2>

        <p>I built Vector Text because I need a good way to add text to SVGs without worrying about font compatibility issues. I searched for an existing tool, but they all had one issue or another. They either didn't work at all, or had weird bugs with no way to report the issues, or were just annoying to use.</p>

        <p>So I built my own tool. Vector Text is a reliable tool that I actually use on a regular basis.</p>
