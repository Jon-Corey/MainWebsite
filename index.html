                <p>I'm Jon Corey, an independent software developer. I recently started working for myself in order to work on the list of ideas I've built up over the past few years. I'm excited to develop these ideas into products that make people's lives just a little bit better.</p>

                <p>I'm currently working on a score counter app for board games and card games. There are already a bunch of apps like these out there, but they all seem to be missing one feature or another that I really want. I'm building my own counter app to include all the features I want, while still being simple and intuitive to use.</p>

                <p>The main benefits of my app is that it can be installed any platform (iOS, Android, Mac, Windows, and Linux) and have as many counters as your device can handle.</p>
